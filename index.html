    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Matilda - Harry Styles</h2>
    <p>
      You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"<br>
      And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels<br>
      Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming 'til now<br>
      So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal<br><br>

      You can let it go<br>
      You can throw a party full of everyone you know<br>
      And not invite your family, 'cause they never showed you love<br>
      You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up, mhm<br><br>

      Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright<br>
      But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead inside<br>
      You showed me a power that is strong enough to bring sun to the darkest days<br>
      It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind<br><br>

      You can let it go<br>
      You can throw a party full of everyone you know<br>
      And not invite your family, 'cause they never showed you love<br>
      You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up<br><br>

      You can see the world, following the seasons<br>
      Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason<br>
      'Cause they never showed you love<br>
      You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own<br><br>

      You're just in time, make your tea and your toast<br>
      You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh<br>
      You don't have to go<br>
      You don't have to go home<br>
      Oh, there's a long way to go<br><br>

      I don't believe that time will change your mind<br>
      In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore<br>
      As long as you can let them go<br><br>

      You can let it go<br>
      You can throw a party full of everyone you know<br>
      You can start a family who will always show you love<br>
      You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own<br><br>

      You can let it go<br>
      You can throw a party full of everyone you know<br>
      You can start a family who will always show you love<br>
      You don't have to be sorry, no
